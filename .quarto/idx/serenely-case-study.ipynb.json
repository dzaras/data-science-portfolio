Users whose usage fades in the first week are highly likely to churn.\n   - **Recommendation**: Implement a \"First Week Rescue\" program.

Target Personas with Tailored Strategies:**\n   - **Insight**: We identified four distinct personas: Power Users, Consistent Dabblers, Fading Casuals, and Early Churners.\n   - **Recommendation for \"Fading Casuals\"**: This group shows declining interest. A/B test different re-engagement strategies for them, such as introducing new content or highlighting the benefits they reported wanting in their sign-up survey.\n   - **Recommendation for \"Power Users\"**: Nurture this group. They are your best customers. Offer them advanced content, beta features, or a community to keep them engaged long-term.\n\n**3. Leverage Initial Sentiments for Onboarding:**\n   - **Insight**: Initial survey answers (e.g., `initial_expect_help`, `initial_enjoy_schedule`) are strong predictors of both engagement and churn.\n   - **Recommendation**: Customize the user onboarding flow based on their survey answers. If a user reports high stress and expects the app to help, immediately guide them to a \"Stress Relief\" program. If they enjoy schedules, prompt them to set a daily meditation reminder. This personalizes the experience from Day 1 and demonstrates value immediately.\n\n**4. Shift Focus from Demographics to Behavior:**\n   - **Insight**: While demographics like age and gender have some predictive power, they are far less important than behavioral features (usage patterns) and initial psychographics (survey answers).\n   - **Recommendation**: Instead of focusing marketing on \"males\" (as a previous analysis suggested), focus marketing messages on the *benefits* that appeal to high-engagement users (e.g., \"Find your focus,\" \"Build a consistent habit\").
