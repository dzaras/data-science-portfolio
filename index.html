    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        Iâ€™m a PhD-trained researcher with 8+ years of experience designing and executing data-driven studies to solve real-world problems. 
      My expertise spans: Advanced Analytics: Statistical modeling (multilevel, longitudinal, NLP), predictive analytics, and experimental design. 
      Mixed-Methods Research: Combining quantitative data (surveys, clinical/behavioral datasets) with qualitative insights (interviews, text analysis). 
      Cross-Domain Applications: From public health and policy to market research and tech, I adapt methods to diverse challenges.
      Communication: Translating technical findings for policymakers, executives, and academic audiences.

    </p>
    <p>
        What I bring to the table:
      A track record of leading studies from design to dissemination, including peer-reviewed publications and stakeholder reports.
      Proficiency in R, Python, SQL, and Git for scalable data analysis.
      Experience managing projects with interdisciplinary teams (clinicians, engineers, policymakers).
